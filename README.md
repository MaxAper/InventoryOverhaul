# Inventory Overhaul for Doom & Doom II
A small tactical gameplay enhancement add-on for Doom and Doom II.

What it adds:
  * Reload to all vanilla weapons.
  * All ammo and medical supplies can actually be in the inventory. This makes it possible to share them with allies in multiplayer.

What is required of a Doom port:
  * "Reload weapon" button
  * "Use inventory item" button
  * (In multiplayer) "Drop inventory item" button
